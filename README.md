## VH-CRIT: Virtual High-Consequence Readiness Incident Training

**Built in Unity and powered by generative AI, VH-CRIT places trainees in high-stakes radiological crisis scenarios where they must make real-time decisions and coordinate with AI-driven first responders.**

Traditional disaster training requires large teams, extensive coordination, and high costs. VH-CRIT streamlines this process by providing **immersive situational awareness** and **realistic dialogue** in a controlled virtual environment, enabling emergency managers to practice protocols more efficiently and effectively.

The system guides trainees through **IAEA response procedures**, evaluating their decision-making against established best practices. This integration of **VR and AI** enhances accessibility and cost-effectiveness while leveraging the proven benefits of virtual reality â€” including higher engagement, improved retention, and better knowledge transfer.
